### 6. Application Form Answers

**Question: "Describe your startup's path to product-market fit"**

Answer:
"Tesoro targets SMEs in LATAM facing 20-50% inflation with automated DeFi treasury management. Our path to PMF:

**Phase 1 (Current):** Validate demand through waitlist (247 businesses, 40% weekly growth) and pilot partners (3 SMEs testing with $150K combined deposits).

**Phase 2 (Q1 2025):** Launch in Argentina post-mainnet deployment. Target 100 paying customers through crypto communities and founder networks. Success metric: $7.5M AUM, 60%+ retention.

**Phase 3 (Q2 2025):** Expand to Mexico and Brazil. Add fiat on-ramps (MercadoPago, PIX) to reduce friction. Target 500 customers, $37M AUM.

**PMF indicators we're tracking:**
- Organic growth rate (currently 40% WoW)
- Customer retention (target 80%+ monthly)
- NPS score (target 50+)
- Referral rate (target 30%+)

**Why we'll reach PMF:**
1. Urgent, painful problem (inflation destroying value)
2. 10x better solution (5-10% APY vs 0.5% banking)
3. Product-market timing (Argentina legalized tokenization 2024)
4. Founder-market fit (lived experience with inflation)"

**Question: "What makes your business model sustainable?"**

Answer:
"Tesoro's business model is sustainable through aligned incentives and strong unit economics:

**Revenue Model:**
- Performance fee: 10% of yield generated (we win when customers win)
- No upfront costs or minimums (removes adoption barriers)
- Predictable recurring revenue tied to AUM

**Unit Economics:**
- Average customer AUM: $75K
- Annual yield at 10% APY: $7,500
- Our revenue per customer: $750/year
- CAC: $150 (organic + content marketing)
- LTV/CAC ratio: 5:1 (assuming 12-month retention)
- Gross margin: 85%+

**Path to $1M ARR:**
- 1,400 customers at $75K average AUM
- Achievable in 18-24 months with LATAM focus
- Requires $200K in customer acquisition spend

**Sustainability factors:**
1. Network effects: More AUM = better yields = more customers
2. High switching costs: Once integrated into treasury workflow, sticky
3. Expanding TAM: 60M+ SMEs globally, starting with 8M in LATAM
4. Multiple revenue streams: Performance fees now, SaaS tiers later
5. Capital efficient: No inventory, minimal infrastructure costs

**Long-term moat:**
- First-mover advantage in SME DeFi treasury
- Regulatory compliance in LATAM markets
- Brand trust in emerging markets
- Data advantage (yield optimization algorithms improve with scale)"

## Questions They Might Ask

**"How is this different from just using Aave directly?"**
"SMEs don't have time or expertise to manage DeFi protocols. We provide one-click access with automated yield optimization, accounting integrations, and compliance reporting."

**"What if DeFi yields drop to 2%?"**
"Even at 2%, we're 4x better than traditional banking. Our model works at any positive yield. We're also building fiat on-ramps to capture the full treasury workflow."

**"How do you acquire customers?"**
"Phase 1: Crypto communities and founder networks (low CAC). Phase 2: Content marketing and SEO. Phase 3: Partnerships with accounting software and fintechs."

**"What's your regulatory strategy?"**
"We start in crypto-friendly jurisdictions (Argentina, El Salvador). We're not a bank or money transmitter - we're software connecting users to DeFi protocols. As we scale, we'll work with local counsel."
