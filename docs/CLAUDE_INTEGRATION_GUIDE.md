# CLAUDE INTEGRATION GUIDE - 10 HOUR SPRINT

## MISSION
Convert Tesoro from UI-only to fully functional testnet MVP ready for Startup World Cup submission.

**Timeline: 10 hours**
**Deadline: Live demo + submission package**

---

## PHASE 1: ENVIRONMENT SETUP (30 mins)

### Step 1: Get API Keys
1. **Alchemy API Key** (for Sepolia testnet)
   - Go to https://www.alchemy.com/
   - Sign up â†’ Create app â†’ Select Sepolia
   - Copy API key

2. **WalletConnect Project ID**
   - Go to https://cloud.walletconnect.com/
   - Create project
   - Copy Project ID

3. **Private Key for Deployment**
   - Create new wallet on MetaMask
   - Export private key (NEVER share publicly)

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables
Create `.env.local`:
\`\`\`
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_walletconnect_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=sepolia
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Get Testnet ETH
1. Go to https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia
2. Paste your wallet address
3. Claim testnet ETH (for gas fees)

---

## PHASE 2: SMART CONTRACT DEPLOYMENT (45 mins)

### Step 1: Deploy TesoroVault Contract
\`\`\`bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contract
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to Sepolia
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network sepolia
\`\`\`

**Expected Output:**
\`\`\`
TesoroVault deployed to: 0x...
USDC Mock deployed to: 0x...
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Update Contract Address
1. Copy the deployed contract address
2. Update in `lib/contracts.ts`:
\`\`\`typescript
export const TESORO_VAULT_ADDRESS = '0x...'; // Your deployed address
export const USDC_ADDRESS = '0x...'; // Your USDC mock address
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Verify Contract (Optional but recommended)
\`\`\`bash
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia 0x... "constructor_args"
\`\`\`

---

## PHASE 3: FRONTEND INTEGRATION (2 hours)

2. Go to http://localhost:3000/dashboard
3. Click "Connect Wallet"
4. Select MetaMask
5. Approve connection
6. Click "Deposit"
7. Enter amount (e.g., 0.1)
8. Approve USDC spending
9. Confirm deposit transaction
10. **Verify:** Balance updates, transaction appears in history

### Step 3: Test Withdraw Flow
1. Click "Withdraw"
2. Enter amount
3. Confirm transaction
4. **Verify:** Balance decreases, transaction recorded

---

## PHASE 4: BACKEND API ROUTES (1 hour)

### Step 1: Create Transaction History API
Create `app/api/transactions/route.ts`:
\`\`\`typescript
// GET /api/transactions?address=0x...
// Returns: Array of transactions from blockchain
// Fetches from Alchemy API or The Graph
\`\`\`

### Step 2: Create Analytics API
Create `app/api/analytics/route.ts`:
\`\`\`typescript
// GET /api/analytics?address=0x...
// Returns: APY, total yield, performance metrics
\`\`\`

### Step 3: Create User Stats API
Create `app/api/user/stats/route.ts`:
\`\`\`typescript
// GET /api/user/stats?address=0x...
// Returns: Balance, yield, allocation, etc.
\`\`\`
